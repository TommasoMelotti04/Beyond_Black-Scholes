# Option Pricing Beyond Blackâ€“Scholes: Empirical Evidence of Fat Tails

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project explores the theoretical foundation of the Blackâ€“Scholesâ€“Merton (BSM) model and critically evaluates its assumptions through empirical data analysis.  
Using long-term historical data from the S&P 500 (1927â€“2024), the study highlights the mismatch between the modelâ€™s assumptions (constant volatility, Gaussian returns, frictionless trading) and real-world financial dynamics.  

The empirical investigation shows clear evidence of **fat tails** in return distributions, suggesting that extreme events are much more frequent than predicted by the Gaussian framework.  
This motivates the need for richer stochastic models, such as **LÃ©vy Î±-stable processes** or other fat-tailed approaches, in option pricing.
